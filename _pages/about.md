Zimu Wang (ÁéãÂ≠êÊú®) is a first-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) (UoL), base at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/) (XJTLU), jointly advised by Dr. [Wei Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/wei-wang03) (XJTLU), Dr. [Qiufeng Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/departments/academic-departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering/staff/qiufeng-wang) (XJTLU), Dr. [Qi Chen](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/departments/academic-departments/school-of-ai-and-advanced-computing/staff/qi-chen02) (XJTLU), and Dr. [Anh Nguyen](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~anguyen/) (UoL). He is also closely collaborating with Dr. [Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/) at the [University of Texas of Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). Before joining XJTLU/UoL, he has worked as a research intern at the [Knowledge Engineering Group](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (KEG), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from 2022 to 2023, supervised by Prof. [Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/).

His broad research interest is the intersection between Knowledge Graphs, Data and Knowledege Engineering, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). To be specific, his current research topics include **Information Extraction**, **Question Answering**, and **Large Language Models**. You can refer to his [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EzXWPgAAAAJ) for his research details <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EzXWPgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
